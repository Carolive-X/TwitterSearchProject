# TwitterSearchProject

Class project for BIOS:7600 Advanced Biostatistics Seminar: Big Data Analysis with Python, offered in Spring 2019. 

The research topic for this project is Chinese culture. This project is coded in python, with an interest to find out how Chinese culture is discussed or disseminated by people from other cultures. THe platform I chosen to investigate is Twitter, where the majority users are not from China.
